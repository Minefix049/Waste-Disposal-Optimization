Waste-Disposal-Optimization
## Introduction
### Background
Solid waste managment remains a critical challenge for urban environments worldwide. With the urban population increasing at an unprecedented rate, it is becoming increasingly urgent to effectively deal with the waste generated by the rapidly growing population. 
### Problem Statement
Shengsi island is a tourism island that faces issues that hinders the effectiveness if its solid waste management system. 66 thousand resident people and the increasing number of tourists on Shengsi Island have led to a decline in the efficiency of the waste disposal system, which has had a serious impact on the island's environment with more than 30,000 kilograms of waste to be disposed of each year. 
The area of Shengsi island is 8824 square kilometer.
### Objective
This study aims to address the multi-level locational planning problem of an intergrated waste management system in Shengsi island using MILP(mixed integer linear programming). The objective is to integrate various apsects of waste management, cosidering environmental, economic and logistical factors to propose a comprehensive solution.
### Literature Reivew
Caruso[1] developed a solid waste management (SWM) planning system comprising three hierarchical levels. This system aimed to efficiently address the complexities of waste management by integrating processes at various stages, from collection to disposal. Through this three-tiered approach, Caruso sought to optimize resource allocation, enhance operational effectiveness, and mitigate environmental impacts associated with waste management practices.

Based on the provided classification system, this can be categorized as follows:

p: Single period.
s: No specific subfields mentioned.
c: No additional constraints or characteristics specified.
o: No specific optimization objectives mentioned.
L: Existing Landfill considered.
TC,FC: Minimized transportation costs and incorporated fixed costs related to existing facility operations or new facility openings,
Therefore, it falls under the category 1/P,L/multiwaste/TC,FC, multiobj model.

Mitropoulos[2] developed an integrated solid waste management (SWM) system operating across four hierarchical levels at the regional scale. This comprehensive system aimed to address the multifaceted challenges of waste management by incorporating strategic planning, logistical coordination, and sustainable practices at each level. By integrating collection, sorting, treatment, and disposal processes within a regional framework, Mitropoulos aimed to optimize resource utilization, minimize environmental impacts, and enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of solid waste management practices within the region.

Based on the provided classification system, this can be categorized as follows:

p: Single period.
s: It includes C and L, indicating consideration of optimal locations for new collection points and existing or new landfill, disposal, or market facilities.
c: No additional constraints or characteristics are mentioned.
o: No specific optimization objectives are mentioned.
S,P,L: Transfer stations, Processing plant, Landfill considered.
TC,FC: Minimized transportation costs and incorporated fixed costs related to existing facility operations or new facility openings,

Therefore, it falls under the category "1/S,P,L/â€“/TC,FC MIP" model.

### Scope
The scope of this research encompasses the applicatioon of open sourced solver like ortools on the MILP model tailored to the specific conditions of shengsi island. This study contributes to the improvement of local waste management practices in Shengsi island. 
## Methodology
### MILP Formulation
Based on the model developed by Mitropoulos, the MIP location allocation models are as follows.  Because of the limited landspace in Shengsi island, this study didn't consider the requirements of transfer station in this model.
### Data Collection
A critical component of our methodology is the collection of accurate and comprehensive data regarding Shengsi island's geography, infrastructure and wate generation patters. To achieve this, we have emplyed the API services of Gaode, a leading provider of mapping and location-based services in china.
we use polygon serach methods provided by Gaode API to collect the data of wate generation distribution. We also used Gaode API to compute the distance matrix of location candidates.

This study used the data of Shengsi island collected from Gaode API to optimize the location planning of process plant and landfill site. For fast converge of the model. we introduced an artificial cuts to the model by constraining the number of landfill sites.
In case of 1 landfill, ...
In case of 2 landfill, ...
