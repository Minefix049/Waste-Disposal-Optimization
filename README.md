Waste-Disposal-Optimization
## Introduction

### Background
Solid waste managment remains a critical challenge for urban environments worldwide. With the urban population increasing at an unprecedented rate, it is becoming increasingly urgent to effectively deal with the waste generated by the rapidly growing population. 

### Problem Statement
Shengsi island is a tourism island that faces issues that hinders the effectiveness if its solid waste management system. 66 thousand resident people and the increasing number of tourists on Shengsi Island have led to a decline in the efficiency of the waste disposal system, which has had a serious impact on the island's environment with more than 30,000 kilograms of waste to be disposed of each year. The area of Shengsi island is 8824 square kilometer.

### Objective
This study aims to address the multi-level locational planning problem of an intergrated waste management system in Shengsi island using MILP(mixed integer linear programming). The objective is to integrate various apsects of waste management, cosidering environmental, economic and logistical factors to propose a comprehensive solution.

### Literature Reivew

We categorize previous study according to the method provided by Ghiani, G[1]. 

The first category "p" corresponds to the periodicity of the problem: p=1 if there is only one cycle, and p=T if more than one cycle is considered. the second category "s" is related to the network structure, which can be subdivided into four categories:

C, if we considered the optimal location of the new collection point.

S, if we considered existing or new transfer stations.

P, if we evaluated the opening of new processing facilities or the optimization of existing processing facilities.

L, if we considered existing or new landfill, disposal or market facilities.

The third category "c" describes additional constraints and characteristics of the problem, which can refine the classification again:

"multiwaste", if we considered multiple types of waste.

"uncert", if there is uncertainty in waste generation.

The last category "o" represents the optimization objective of this problem:

TC, if it minimized transportation costs.

PC, if it consider the processing costs of the facility.

FC, if it includes fixed costs of operating existing facilities or opening new facilities.

"multiobj", if we consider multi-objective optimization.

Caruso[2] developed a solid waste management (SWM) planning system comprising three hierarchical levels. This system aimed to efficiently address the complexities of waste management by integrating processes at various stages, from collection to disposal. Through this three-tiered approach, Caruso sought to optimize resource allocation, enhance operational effectiveness, and mitigate environmental impacts associated with waste management practices.

Based on the provided classification system, this can be categorized as follows:

p: Single period.
s: No specific subfields mentioned.
c: No additional constraints or characteristics specified.
o: No specific optimization objectives mentioned.
L: Existing Landfill considered.
TC,FC: Minimized transportation costs and incorporated fixed costs related to existing facility operations or new facility openings,
Therefore, it falls under the category 1/P,L/multiwaste/TC,FC, multiobj model.

Mitropoulos[3] developed an integrated solid waste management (SWM) system operating across four hierarchical levels at the regional scale. This comprehensive system aimed to address the multifaceted challenges of waste management by incorporating strategic planning, logistical coordination, and sustainable practices at each level. By integrating collection, sorting, treatment, and disposal processes within a regional framework, Mitropoulos aimed to optimize resource utilization, minimize environmental impacts, and enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of solid waste management practices within the region.

Based on the provided classification system, this can be categorized as follows:

p: Single period.
s: It includes C and L, indicating consideration of optimal locations for new collection points and existing or new landfill, disposal, or market facilities.
c: No additional constraints or characteristics are mentioned.
o: No specific optimization objectives are mentioned.
S,P,L: Transfer stations, Processing plant, Landfill considered.
TC,FC: Minimized transportation costs and incorporated fixed costs related to existing facility operations or new facility openings,

Therefore, it falls under the category "1/S,P,L/â€“/TC,FC MIP" model.

## Methodology

This study refines the solid waste management system on Shengsi Island through a detailed analysis of waste generation, leveraging the actual coordinates of existing waste collection centers and sophisticated geospatial data analysis. Notably, the study employs the Google OR-Tools SAT solver to model and solve the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, facilitating an innovative approach to estimating waste generation based on the distribution of residential areas.

### Geography data collection
A critical component of our methodology is the collection of accurate and comprehensive data regarding Shengsi island's geography, infrastructure and wate generation patters. To achieve this, we have emplyed the services of Gaode, a leading provider of mapping and location-based services in china. We find out the latitude and longitude coordinates of exisitng collection centers on Gaode Map. We also define the polygons to represent operational coverage areas of each collection centers. Moreover we use polygon serach methods provided by Gaode API to collect the data of residential facilities in each operation coverage area. We also use Gaode API to compute the distance matrix of location candidates.

### Utilizating Existing Collection Centers
Our methodology is based on utilizating existing waste collection centers on Shengsi Island. We use real coordinates of these centers to accurately divide the island into sectors and mak sure that each sector is efficiently served. These sectors are delineated based on the operational coverage of each collection center, using polygon coordinates to define their geographical boundaries precisely.

### Collection and Analysis of Residential Area Data
The estimation of waste generation begins with a comprehensive collection of data on residential areas within each defined sector. Through the Gaode polygon search API, we gather detailed information on residential units, employing specific keywords to ensure a thorough identification of all relevant residential entities. This method allows for an accurate representation of the residential landscape within each sector.

### Estimating Waste Generation with Residential Count Ratios
A key innovation in our methodology is the estimation of waste generation through the ratio of residential counts in each sector. This approach allows for a proportional and realistic assessment of waste production, acknowledging the varying population densities and residential distributions across the island. By correlating the number of residential units to estimated waste output, we offer a nuanced view of waste generation that surpasses traditional, uniform estimations.

### collection of distance matrix data
A critical aspect of our study involved the acquisition of accurate and comprehensive data pertaining to Shengsi Island's geography, infrastructure, and waste generation patterns. This section outlines the methodologies employed to gather the requisite data and the tools utilized for analysis.We utilized Gaode's API to compute distance matrices between potential facility sites and waste generation centroids, employing advanced routing algorithms and geographic data. This enabled us to optimize facility placement, minimizing transportation costs and logistical challenges in designing a solid waste management system for Shengsi Island.

### MILP Modeling with Google OR-Tools SAT Solver
To support the analytical processes of this study, we employ the Google OR-Tools SAT solver for modeling and solving the MILP problems inherent in estimating waste generation and optimizing collection center operations. This powerful tool enables us to handle complex optimization problems efficiently, providing a robust framework for the strategic planning and management of the island's waste management system. The use of Google OR-Tools SAT solver underpins our methodological approach, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of our waste generation estimates and sector-based management strategies.

### Comprehensive Approach for Solid Waste Management Optimization
Integrating real-world data on collection centers with advanced modeling and analytical techniques, this study presents a comprehensive approach to optimizing solid waste management on Shengsi Island. By accurately estimating waste generation and employing sophisticated MILP modeling, we lay the groundwork for a more efficient, targeted, and sustainable waste management infrastructure that is finely tuned to the specific needs and characteristics of the island's sectors.

### Process plant and landfill candidate selection
We selected several location candidates for both process plant and landfill by considering following criteria.

â€¢ Environmental Impact: Candidate locations were chosen to minimize disturbance to inland ecosystems and residential areas. 

â€¢ Land Use Efficiency: Sites were selected to avoid conflicts with residential and conservation areas, optimizing land utilization. 

â€¢ Energy and Resource Recovery: Coastal locations were preferred to utilize seawater for cooling processes and maximize energy and resource recovery opportunities. 

These criteria ensure the selected locations contribute to sustainable waste management while minimizing environmental impact and maximizing resource efficiency on Shengsi Island.

Need to copy the location candidates overhere!!

### Distance Matrix

We planned waste routes using Gaode API, obtaining two crucial distance matrices. We selected Strategy 13 - No Highway- to plan the route in case of considering city capacity. By inputting waste processing points' coordinates, we obtained shortest path distances, forming matrices. 

The Waste Collection Distance Matrix illustrates straight-line distances between processing points. 

The Landfill Processing Plant Distance Matrix shows distances from processing points to the landfill. 

These matrices support waste disposal planning, aiding decision-makers in strategy formulation and route optimization for enhanced efficiency and environmental sustainability.
