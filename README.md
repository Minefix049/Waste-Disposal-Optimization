Waste-Disposal-Optimization
## Introduction
### Background
Solid waste managment remains a critical challenge for urban environments worldwide. With the urban population increasing at an unprecedented rate, it is becoming increasingly urgent to effectively deal with the waste generated by the rapidly growing population. 
### Problem Statement
Shengsi island is a tourism island that faces issues that hinders the effectiveness if its solid waste management system. 66 thousand resident people and the increasing number of tourists on Shengsi Island have led to a decline in the efficiency of the waste disposal system, which has had a serious impact on the island's environment with more than 30,000 kilograms of waste to be disposed of each year. 
The area of Shengsi island is 8824 square kilometer.
### Objective
This study aims to address the multi-level locational planning problem of an intergrated waste management system in Shengsi island using MILP(mixed integer linear programming). The objective is to integrate various apsects of waste management, cosidering environmental, economic and logistical factors to propose a comprehensive solution.
### Literature Reivew

We categorize them according to the different types of problems. 
The first category "p" corresponds to the periodicity of the problem: p=1 if there is only one cycle, and p=T if more than one cycle is considered. the second category "s" is related to the network structure, which can be subdivided into four categories:
C, if we considered the optimal location of the new collection point.
S, if we considered existing or new transfer stations.
P, if we evaluated the opening of new processing facilities or the optimization of existing processing facilities.
L, if we considered existing or new landfill, disposal or market facilities.

The third category "c" describes additional constraints and characteristics of the problem, which can refine the classification again:
"multiwaste", if we considered multiple types of waste.
"uncert", if there is uncertainty in waste generation.

The last category "o" represents the optimization objective of this problem:
TC, if it minimized transportation costs.
PC, if it consider the processing costs of the facility.
FC, if it includes fixed costs of operating existing facilities or opening new facilities.
"multiobj", if we consider multi-objective optimization.

Caruso[1] developed a solid waste management (SWM) planning system comprising three hierarchical levels. This system aimed to efficiently address the complexities of waste management by integrating processes at various stages, from collection to disposal. Through this three-tiered approach, Caruso sought to optimize resource allocation, enhance operational effectiveness, and mitigate environmental impacts associated with waste management practices.

Based on the provided classification system, this can be categorized as follows:

p: Single period.
s: No specific subfields mentioned.
c: No additional constraints or characteristics specified.
o: No specific optimization objectives mentioned.
L: Existing Landfill considered.
TC,FC: Minimized transportation costs and incorporated fixed costs related to existing facility operations or new facility openings,
Therefore, it falls under the category 1/P,L/multiwaste/TC,FC, multiobj model.

Mitropoulos[2] developed an integrated solid waste management (SWM) system operating across four hierarchical levels at the regional scale. This comprehensive system aimed to address the multifaceted challenges of waste management by incorporating strategic planning, logistical coordination, and sustainable practices at each level. By integrating collection, sorting, treatment, and disposal processes within a regional framework, Mitropoulos aimed to optimize resource utilization, minimize environmental impacts, and enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of solid waste management practices within the region.

Based on the provided classification system, this can be categorized as follows:

p: Single period.
s: It includes C and L, indicating consideration of optimal locations for new collection points and existing or new landfill, disposal, or market facilities.
c: No additional constraints or characteristics are mentioned.
o: No specific optimization objectives are mentioned.
S,P,L: Transfer stations, Processing plant, Landfill considered.
TC,FC: Minimized transportation costs and incorporated fixed costs related to existing facility operations or new facility openings,

Therefore, it falls under the category "1/S,P,L/–/TC,FC MIP" model.

### Scope
This study refines the solid waste management system on Shengsi Island through a detailed analysis of waste generation, leveraging the actual coordinates of existing waste collection centers and sophisticated geospatial data analysis. Notably, the study employs the Google OR-Tools SAT solver to model and solve the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, facilitating an innovative approach to estimating waste generation based on the distribution of residential areas.
## Methodology

### Indices and Sets
•$J$: Set of collection centers

•$K$: Set of transfer stations (not used in this scenario)

•$F$: Set of treatment plant candidates by the seaside

•$L$: Set of landfill candidates

•$G$: Set of treatment types, $G$ ={"$incinerator$"," $composting$"," $recycling$"}

### Objective

Minimize:
$\sum_{j\in J}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{g\in G}C_T·d_{j,f}·x_{j,f,g}+\sum_{j\in J}\sum_{l\in L}C_T·d_{j,l}·y_{j,l}$
$+\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{l\in L}\sum_{g\in G}C_T·d_{f,l}·z_{f,l,g}$
$+\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{g\in G}(C_{F,g}·b_{f,g}+C_{V,g}·x_{j,f,g})+\sum_{j\in J}\sum_{l\in L}C_L·y_{j,l}$

### Constraints
• Waste Generation and Allocation Constraint for Each Collection Center:
$\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{g\in G}x_{j,f,g}+\sum_{l\in L}y_{j,l}=W_j\ \ \forall j\in J$

• Treatment Plant Capacity Constraint:
$\sum_{j\in J}x_{j,f,g}\leq CAP_{F,g}·b_{f,g}\ \ \forall f\in F, \forall g \in G$

• Landfill Capacity Constraint:
$\sum_{j\in J}y_{j,l}+\sum_{f \in F}\sum_{g\in G}z_{f,l,g}\leq CAP_L\ \ \forall l\in L$

• Treatment to Landfill Transport:
$z_{f,l,g}=\alpha_{g}·\sum_{j\in J}x_{j,f,g}\ \ \forall f\in F,\forall l\in L,\forall g\in G$
Where $a_g$ is the reduction factor after treatment $g$.

• Binary Treatment Plant Selection:
$b_{f,g}\in\{0,1\}\ \ \forall f\in F,\forall g\in G$

• Landfill Count Upper Bound:
Let $L_{max}$ be the maximum number of landfill sites that can be selected for use.

• Landfill Selection Upper Bound Constraint:
$\sum_{l\in L}u_l\leq L_{max}$

### MILP Formulation
Based on the model developed by Mitropoulos, the MIP location allocation models are as follows.  Because of the limited landspace in Shengsi island, this study didn't consider the requirements of transfer station in this model.
### Data Collection
A critical component of our methodology is the collection of accurate and comprehensive data regarding Shengsi island's geography, infrastructure and wate generation patters. To achieve this, we have emplyed the API services of Gaode, a leading provider of mapping and location-based services in china.
we use polygon serach methods provided by Gaode API to collect the data of wate generation distribution. We also used Gaode API to compute the distance matrix of location candidates.
